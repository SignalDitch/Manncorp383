User Docs, Libraries and Miscellany related to our exploration of the Manncorp 383V Automatic PnP machine

## History

The Automatic Pick-and-Place machine at Signal Ditch (given name: Optimus Prime) was last owned by SparkFun Electronics, where it served as their first Pick-and-Place machine starting in 2007. Sometime between 2015 and 2016, it was purchased for $<not-as-many-as-you-might-think> by Chopper, who later left the company to work in Aerospace. Chopper boarded the machine in his garage and promptly got busy with work and competitve robotics. In late 2017, Nick offered to operate the machine at Signal Ditch in order to get it out of Chopper's garage. An agreement was reached whereby Nick would operate the machine until either he could pay for it or until Chopper decides to sell it. 

## Value

Machine base cost lists at $44,995 although this model in particular is discontinued. Feeders range from $550 to $2000 depending on size and type. Signal Ditch and Chopper have 30+ feeders.

## Documentation 

Documentation is hard to come by for this discontinued model. Most of it comes by way of a few large binders that traveled with the machine, as well as entries in the early SparkFun wiki by way of the AdaWiki at Ladyada.net
